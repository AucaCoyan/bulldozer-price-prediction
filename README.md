# bulldozer-price-prediction
A machine learning algorithm to predict price of bulldozers based on features.

## Problem
Starting from a list of sales of bulldozers, predict the price of a bulldozer yet to sell.

## Data
The data is taken from Kaggle's competition [Blue Book for bulldozers](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data).

## Evaluation
The evaluation metric is RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and the predicted auction prices.

## Features
Kaggle provides a .csv for describing features of the dataset. You can found it in `data/Data Dictonary.xlsx`

## I have another question, where can I find you?
